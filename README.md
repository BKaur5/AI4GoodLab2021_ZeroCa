Building an AI tool to predict energy consumption of households, and their energy bills for effective future planning 
purposes. For the future, we plan to recommend solutions specific to the user as per his location, budget, comfort, 
and other constraints to reduce his carbon footprint and cost at the same time. This is the idea from where the name ZeroCa, 
meaning Zero Carbon comes from.

The dataset was acquired from a household in Vancouver which includes appliance level power consumption and weather data for a house over a period of time.

We implemented the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.
